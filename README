This module wraps the MPFI C library functions.

This version of Math::MPFI needs mpfi-1.5 or later.

The MPFI library is intended to be a portable library written in C
for arbitrary precision interval arithmetic with intervals represented
using MPFR reliable floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP
(GMP) library and on the MPFR library.

MPFI, like MPFR and GMP, is free. It is distributed under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU Lesser GPL).

Because this module wraps the MPFI functions, it requires that the
MPFI library (version 1.5 or later), the GMP library (version 4.2.0
or later) and the MPFR library (version 2.3.0 or later) have been
installed.

For the GMP library see:
http://gmplib.org

For the MPFR library see:
http://www.mpfr.org
Do not use the (outdated) MPFR library source that ships with the
GMP source.

For the MPFI library see:
https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/mpfi/

You'll also need to have Math::MPFR (version 2.01 or later) installed.

To build this module you need perl 5.6.0 or later. I'm not sure of all
the requirements to get it to build with earlier versions of perl, but
it's definite that the XS code relating to operator overloading will
not compile with perl versions prior to 5.6.

Build in the usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

When building this module, the MPFI, GMP and MPFR libraries will need to be
accessible. If those files are in a location where your compiler does
not find them by default, then instead of running 'perl Makefile.PL',
you'll need to run:

perl Makefile.pl INC="-I/path/to/gmp_includes -I/path/to/mpfr_includes -I/path/to/mpfi/include"
 LIBS="-L/path/to/mpfi_lib -lmpfi -L/path/to/mpfr_lib -lmpfr -L/path/to/gmp_lib -lgmp"

If your perl's Config reports that 'ivsize' is greater than or
equal to 8, then Math::MPFI will, by default, be built assuming access
to the mpfr_*_uj and mpfr_*_sj functions. Else, access to those
functions is, by default, denied. You can override the default by
opening up the Makefile.PL and uncommenting the appropriate line (just
a few lines down from the top of the file ... the comments in that
file should make it clear).

Similarly, if your perl's Config reports that 'nvsize' is greater than
8 then Math::MPFI will, by default, be built assuming access
to the mpfr_*_ld functions. Else, access to those functions is,
by default, denied. Again, you can override the default by opening up the
Makefile.PL and uncommenting the appropriate line.
If your 'nvtype' is __float128 and your mpfr library was built with the
configure option --enable-float128, then you can access the __float128
values using the overloaded operators if you build the module with:
perl Makefile.PL F128=1
(or if you set $have_float128 to 1 in the Makefile.PL).

It's certainly possible that the default behaviour is inappropriate for
some perl/compiler configurations. Please let me know if you strike such
a "perl/compiler configuration". I am contactable via email at
sisyphus at(@) cpan dot (.) org.
